    //   Our team came together through a shared passion for technology and design.</p>

    //   <p>Here are some of the values that guided us:</p>
    //   <ul>
    //     <li>📘 Transparency in decision-making</li>
    //     <li>🤝 Collaborative work culture</li>
    //     <li>💡 Constant innovation and iteration</li>
    //   </ul>

    //   <p>Our first workspace looked nothing like it does now. We used to work from a small garage 
    //   with a single whiteboard and two desks.</p>

        <p><strong>Not all challenges are visible</strong>, and not all privileges are recognized at first glance.</p>
        
        <p>During a recent visit to a government hospital to obtain my <strong>Unique Disability ID (UDID)</strong>, I witnessed people with visible and severe disabilities enduring long queues — not just for treatment, but for basic documentation.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, I waited comfortably while my father stood in line for me — a stark reminder of the <em>silent privileges</em> that cushion many of us.</p>
        
        <p>Born into a home filled with love and opportunity, I was shielded from much hardship. Yet <strong>self-acceptance</strong> was still a long internal battle.</p>
        
        <p>This moment reinforced a powerful truth: <strong>Inclusion isn’t about policies — it’s about empathy, acknowledgment, and creating spaces where every story matters.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>A Commitment to Change</h3>
        <p>I am committed to building platforms that recognize every woman’s journey — making them feel truly <strong>seen, heard, and celebrated</strong>.</p>

        <p>Stepping away from the conventional path, I chose a life anchored in <strong>purpose</strong>, <strong>growth</strong>, and <strong>community building</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The foundation of my journey has been my <strong>family</strong>, mentors, and the supportive network around me:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>👨‍👧 <strong>My father</strong>, my unwavering source of strength.</li>
          <li>👩‍👧 <strong>My mother</strong>, whose wit, warmth, and entrepreneurial spirit light up every room.</li>
          <li>🧠 <strong>My sister</strong>, a behavioral analyst dedicated to helping children with autism and Down syndrome — inspiring me daily with her compassion.</li>
          <li>💻 <strong>My brother-in-law</strong>, a tech expert whose kindness and support define true strength.</li>
          <li>🎀 <strong>My two nieces, Meher and Mehak</strong> — sharp, spirited, and the future I dream to help shape.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Through <strong>TakeMeAway</strong>, I invite women to connect, grow, and create powerful journeys of their own.</p>
        
        <p><em>Let’s build something bigger — together.</em></p>
