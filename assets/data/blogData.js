        <p>While I was on a break after my surgery, I had time to slow down and think about what really matters to me. That’s when I got the opportunity to teach over 100 kids, aged 5 to 12, at the Shiv Nagar Jain Mandir in Shree Vidyasagar Sanskar Vatika Pathshala, Jabalpur.</p>
        
        <p>I chose to teach them something I struggled with for years—how to build confidence. I was never taught this as a child, and it took me a long time to believe in myself. So, I wanted to give these kids a better start.</p>
        
        <p>We kept it simple with 3 rules: respect each other, clap for each other, and most of all, have fun in the class. I asked them to say, “I have the power!” and feel it in their hearts. The way they joined in, with energy and excitement, made me feel proud and full of hope.</p>
        
        <p>One little girl said something that stayed with me—“I feel like I live in Swarg (heaven).” Her words reminded me to see the beauty in life and feel grateful for every moment.</p>
        
        <p>To be honest, I never thought I’d enjoy working with kids. I didn’t think I had the patience. But this experience changed my thinking. I felt calm, happy, and full of purpose.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes, life takes you where you’re meant to be—not through plans, but through surprises. Teaching these little hearts helped me reconnect with mine. And maybe, just maybe, this is where my real journey begins.</p>

        <p>Stepping away from the conventional path, I chose a life anchored in <strong>purpose</strong>, <strong>growth</strong>, and <strong>community building</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The foundation of my journey has been my <strong>family</strong>, mentors, and the supportive network around me:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>👨‍👧 <strong>My father</strong>, my unwavering source of strength.</li>
          <li>👩‍👧 <strong>My mother</strong>, whose wit, warmth, and entrepreneurial spirit light up every room.</li>
          <li>🧠 <strong>My sister</strong>, a behavioral analyst dedicated to helping children with autism and Down syndrome — inspiring me daily with her compassion.</li>
          <li>💻 <strong>My brother-in-law</strong>, a tech expert whose kindness and support define true strength.</li>
          <li>🎀 <strong>My two nieces, Meher and Mehak</strong> — sharp, spirited, and the future I dream to help shape.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Through <strong>TakeMeAway</strong>, I invite women to connect, grow, and create powerful journeys of their own.</p>

        <p><strong>Not all challenges are visible</strong>, and not all privileges are recognized at first glance.</p>
        
        <p>During a recent visit to a government hospital to obtain my <strong>Unique Disability ID (UDID)</strong>, I witnessed people with visible and severe disabilities enduring long queues — not just for treatment, but for basic documentation.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, I waited comfortably while my father stood in line for me — a stark reminder of the <em>silent privileges</em> that cushion many of us.</p>
        
        <p>Born into a home filled with love and opportunity, I was shielded from much hardship. Yet <strong>self-acceptance</strong> was still a long internal battle.</p>
        
        <p>This moment reinforced a powerful truth: <strong>Inclusion isn’t about policies — it’s about empathy, acknowledgment, and creating spaces where every story matters.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>A Commitment to Change</h3>
        <p>I am committed to building platforms that recognize every woman’s journey — making them feel truly <strong>seen, heard, and celebrated</strong>.</p>

        <p>For years, I pushed through the warning signs — persistent neck and shoulder pain — until a slipped disc in my cervical spine forced me to stop.</p>
        <p>After surgery and 3 months of healing, I realized that pausing is not a weakness — it’s an act of self-respect and survival.</p>
        <p>I embraced a new way of living: prioritizing rest, mindfulness, meditation, journaling, and spiritual practices.</p>
        <p>This journey taught me that ambition must never come at the cost of health.</p>
        <p><strong>To all the driven women out there:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Pause. Listen to your body. Set your boundaries.<br>Your dreams need your health more than your hustle.</em></p>
